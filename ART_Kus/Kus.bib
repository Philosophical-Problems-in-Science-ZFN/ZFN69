Second, if we relax the demand that norm be preserved, we end up with a theory that allows rapid solution of PP-complete problems (as well as superluminal signalling). And third, if we restrict amplitudes to be real, we run into a difficulty much simpler than the usual one based on parameter-counting of mixed states.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to relate algebraic quantum mechanics to topos theory, so as to construct new foundations for quantum logic and quantum spaces. Motivated by Bohr’s idea that the empirical content of quantum physics is accessible only through classical physics, we show how a noncommutative C*-algebra of observables A induces a topos \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{T\}(A)\}\$\$in which the amalgamation of all of its commutative subalgebras comprises a single commutative C*-algebra \$\$\{{\textbackslash}underline\{A\}\}\$\$. According to the constructive Gelfand duality theorem of Banaschewski and Mulvey, the latter has an internal spectrum \$\$\{{\textbackslash}underline\{{\textbackslash}Sigma\}({\textbackslash}underline\{A\})\}\$\$in \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{T\}(A)\}\$\$, which in our approach plays the role of the quantum phase space of the system. Thus we associate a locale (which is the topos-theoretical notion of a space and which intrinsically carries the intuitionistic logical structure of a Heyting algebra) to a C*-algebra (which is the noncommutative notion of a space). In this setting, states on A become probability measures (more precisely, valuations) on \$\$\{{\textbackslash}underline\{{\textbackslash}Sigma\}\}\$\$, and self-adjoint elements of A define continuous functions (more precisely, locale maps) from \$\$\{{\textbackslash}underline\{{\textbackslash}Sigma\}\}\$\$to Scott’s interval domain. Noting that open subsets of \$\$\{{\textbackslash}underline\{{\textbackslash}Sigma\}({\textbackslash}underline\{A\})\}\$\$correspond to propositions about the system, the pairing map that assigns a (generalized) truth value to a state and a proposition assumes an extremely simple categorical form. Formulated in this way, the quantum theory defined by A is essentially turned into a classical theory, internal to the topos \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{T\}(A)\}\$\$.},

The second, loosely generalizing Stone duality, maintains that the category of ‘point-free spaces’ is the opposite of the category of frames (that is, complete lattices in which the meet distributes over arbitrary joins). Earlier work by the first three authors shows how a noncommutative C*-algebra gives rise to a commutative one internal to a certain sheaf topos. The latter, then, has a constructive Gelfand spectrum, also internal to the topos in question. After a brief review of this work, we compute the so-called external description of this internal spectrum, which in principle is a fibred point-free space in the familiar topos of sets and functions. However, we obtain the external spectrum as a fibred topological space in the usual sense. This leads to an explicit Gelfand transform, as well as to a topological reinterpretation of the Kochen–Specker theorem of quantum mechanics.},

The book builds on the concepts introduced in the first volume (published as Lect.

And how can these issues be solved within a new theoretical framework of quantum theory? These two volumes together provide a complete, basic course on topos quantum theory, offering a set of mathematical tools to readers interested in tackling fundamental issues in quantum theory in general, and in quantum gravity in particular. From the reviews of the first volume: The book is self-contained and can be used as a textbook or self-study manual teaching the usage of category theory and topos theory, in particular in theoretical physics or in investigating the foundations of quantum theory in mathematically rigorous terms.
