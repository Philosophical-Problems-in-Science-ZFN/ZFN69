	abstract = {Fruitful ideas on how to quantize gravity are few and far between. In this paper, we give a complete description of a recently introduced non-perturbative gravitational path integral whose continuum limit has already been investigated extensively in d{\textless}4, with promising results. It is based on a simplicial regularization of Lorentzian spacetimes and, most importantly, possesses a well-defined, non-perturbative Wick rotation. We present a detailed analysis of the geometric and mathematical properties of the discretized model in d=3,4. This includes a derivation of Lorentzian simplicial manifold constraints, the gravitational actions and their Wick rotation. We define a transfer matrix for the system and show that it leads to a well-defined self-adjoint Hamiltonian. In view of numerical simulations, we also suggest sets of Lorentzian Monte Carlo moves. We demonstrate that certain pathological phases found previously in Euclidean models of dynamical triangulations cannot be realized in the Lorentzian case.},

Motivated by killing this zero’th cohomology, we consider the directed system of finite-dimensional Hopf algebras Ad=Fp[x]/(gd)\$A\_\{d\}={\textbackslash}mathbb \{F\}\_\{p\}[x]/(g\_\{d\})\$ as well as their inherited bicovariant differential calculi Ω(Ad;m). We show that Ad = Cd ⊗χA1 is a cocycle extension where Cd=Adψ\$C\_\{d\}=A\_\{d\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}psi \}\$ is the subalgebra of elements fixed under ψ(x) = x + 1.

The connection is compatible with a natural quantum symplectic structure and associated generalised quantum metric. A remnant of our approach also works on any symplectic manifold where, by extending the calculus, we can encode any hamiltonian flow as `geodesics' for a certain connection with torsion which is moreover compatible with an extended symplectic structure. Thus we formulate ordinary quantum mechanics in a way that more resembles gravity rather than the more well-studied idea of formulating geometry in a more quantum manner. We then apply the same approach to the Klein Gordon equation on Minkowski space with a background electromagnetic field, formulating quantum `geodesics' on the relevant relativistic Heisenberg algebra. Examples include a proper time relativistic free particle wave packet and a hydrogen-like atom.},

	abstract = {This book provides a comprehensive account of a modern generalisation of differential geometry in which coordinates need not commute. This requires a reinvention of differential geometry that refers only to the coordinate algebra, now possibly noncommutative, rather than to actual points.Such a theory is needed for the geometry of Hopf algebras or quantum groups, which provide key examples, as well as in physics to model quantum gravity effects in the form of quantum spacetime. The mathematical formalism can be applied to any algebra and includes graph geometry and a Lie theory of finite groups. Even the algebra of 2 x 2 matrices turns out to admit a rich moduli of quantum Riemannian geometries. The approach taken is a `bottom up’ one in which the different layers of geometry are built up in succession, starting from differential forms and proceeding up to the notion of a quantum `Levi-Civita’ bimodule connection, geometric Laplacians and, in some cases, Dirac operators. The book also covers elements of Connes’ approach to the subject coming from cyclic cohomology and spectral triples. Other topics include various other cohomology theories, holomorphic structures and noncommutative D-modules.A unique feature of the book is its constructive approach and its wealth of examples drawn from a large body of literature in mathematical physics, now put on a firm algebraic footing. Including exercises with solutions, it can be used as a textbook for advanced courses as well as a reference for researchers.},

	abstract = {The goal of this article is to summarise the first steps in developing a fundamentally new way of constructing theories of physics. The motivation comes from a desire to address certain deep issues that arise when contemplating quantum theories of space and time. In doing so we provide a new answer to Heidegger’s timeless question “What is a thing?”.Our basic contention is that constructing a theory of physics is equivalent to finding a representation in a topos of a certain formal language that is attached to the system. Classical physics uses the topos of sets. Other theories involve a different topos. For the types of theory discussed in this article, a key goal is to represent any physical quantity A with an arrow 𝐴˘𝜙:𝛴𝜙→𝜙{\textbackslash}breve\{A\}\_{\textbackslash}phi:{\textbackslash}varSigma\_{\textbackslash}phi{\textbackslash}rightarrow\{{\textbackslash}cal R\}\_{\textbackslash}phi where Σ φ and 𝜙\{{\textbackslash}cal R\}\_{\textbackslash}phi are two special objects (the “state object” and “quantity-value object”) in the appropriate topos,τ φ .We discuss two different types of language that can be attached to a system, S. The first, (𝑆){\textbackslash}mathcal\{PL\}(S), is a propositional language; the second, (𝑆){\textbackslash}mathcal\{L\}(\{S\}), is a higher-order, typed language. Both languages provide deductive systems with an intuitionistic logic. With the aid of (𝑆){\textbackslash}mathcal\{PL\}(S) we expand and develop some of the earlier work1 on topos theory and quantum physics. A key step is a process we term “daseinisation” by which a projection operator is mapped to a sub-object of the spectral presheaf 𝛴⎯⎯⎯\{{\textbackslash}underline\{{\textbackslash}varSigma\}\}—the topos quantum analogue of a classical state space. The topos concerned is 𝐒𝐞𝐭𝐬()op{\textbackslash}textbf\{Sets\}\{{\textbackslash}cal V\}(\{{\textbackslash}cal H\}){\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{op\}\}: the category of contravariant set-valued functors on the category (partially ordered set) ()\{{\textbackslash}cal V\}(\{{\textbackslash}cal H\}) of commutative sub-algebras of the algebra of bounded operators on the quantum Hilbert space \{{\textbackslash}cal H\}.There are two types of daseinisation, called “outer” and “inner”: they involve approximating a projection operator by projectors that are, respectively, larger and smaller in the lattice of projectors on \{{\textbackslash}cal H\}.We then introduce the more sophisticated language (𝑆){\textbackslash}mathcal\{L\}(\{S\}) and use it to study “truth objects” and “pseudo-states” in the topos. These objects play the role of states: a necessary development as the spectral presheaf has no global elements, and hence there are no microstates in the sense of classical physics.One of the main mathematical achievements is finding a topos representation for self-adjoint operators. This involves showing that, for any bounded, self-adjoint operator 𝐴̂ \{{\textbackslash}hat A\}, there is a corresponding arrow 𝛿˘𝑜(𝐴̂ ):𝛴⎯⎯⎯→ℝ⪰⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯\{{\textbackslash}breve\{{\textbackslash}delta\}{\textasciicircum}o({\textbackslash}hat\{A\})\}:\{{\textbackslash}underline\{{\textbackslash}varSigma\}\}{\textbackslash}rightarrow\{{\textbackslash}underline\{\{{\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}succeq\}\}\} where ℝ⪰⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯\{{\textbackslash}underline\{\{{\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}succeq\}\}\} is the quantity-value object for this theory. The construction of 𝛿˘𝑜(𝐴̂ )\{{\textbackslash}breve\{{\textbackslash}delta\}{\textasciicircum}o({\textbackslash}hat\{A\})\} is an extension of the daseinisation of projection operators.The object ℝ⪰⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯\{{\textbackslash}underline\{\{{\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}succeq\}\}\} can serve as the quantity-value object if only outer daseinisation of self-adjoint operators is used in the construction of arrows 𝛿˘𝑜(𝐴̂ ):𝛴⎯⎯⎯→ℝ⪰⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯\{{\textbackslash}breve\{{\textbackslash}delta\}{\textasciicircum}o({\textbackslash}hat\{A\})\}:\{{\textbackslash}underline\{{\textbackslash}varSigma\}\}{\textbackslash}rightarrow\{{\textbackslash}underline\{\{{\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}succeq\}\}\}. If both inner and outer daseinisation are used, then a related presheaf ℝ↔⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯\{{\textbackslash}underline\{{\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}leftrightarrow\}\}\} is the appropriate choice. Moreover, in order to enhance the applicability of the quantity-value object, one can consider a topos analogue of the Grothendieck extension of a monoid to a group, applied to ℝ⪰⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯\{{\textbackslash}underline\{\{{\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}succeq\}\}\} (resp. ℝ↔⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯\{{\textbackslash}underline\{{\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}leftrightarrow\}\}\}). The resulting object, 𝑘(ℝ⪰⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯)\{k(\{{\textbackslash}underline\{\{{\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}succeq\}\}\})\} (resp. 𝑘(ℝ↔⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯)k(\{{\textbackslash}underline\{{\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}leftrightarrow\}\}\})), is an abelian group-object in τ φ .Finally we turn to considering a collection of systems: in particular, we are interested in the relation between the topos representation of a composite system, and the representations of its constituents. Our approach to these matters is to construct a category of systems and to find coherent topos representations of the entire category.},

	abstract = {We present a path integral formalism for quantising gravity in the form of the spectral action. Our basic principle is to sum over all Dirac operators. The approach is demonstrated on two simple finite noncommutative geometries: the two-point space, and the matrix geometry M2(C). On the first, the graviton is described by a Higgs field, and on the second, it is described by a gauge field. We start with the partition function and calculate the propagator and Greens functions for the gravitons. The expectation values of distances are evaluated and we discover that distances shrink with increasing graviton excitations. We find that adding fermions reduces the effects of the gravitational field. A comparison is also made with Rovelli’s canonical quantisation approach, and with his idea of spectral path integrals. We include a brief discussion on the quantisation of a Riemannian manifold.},

It is also known that groups and Hopf algebras (quantum groups) lead to classical and quantum diffusions. We study here the more primitive notion of a quantum random walk associated with a general Hopf algebra and show that it has a simple physical interpretation in quantum mechanics. This is by means of a representation theorem motivated from the theory of Kac algebras: If H is any Hopf algebra, it may be realized in Lin(H) in such a way that Δh=W(h⊗1)W−1 for an operator W. This W is interpreted as the time evolution operator for the system at time t coupled quantum-mechanically to the system at time t+δ. Finally, for every Hopf algebra there is a dual one, leading us to a duality operation for quantum random walks and quantum diffusions and a notion of the coentropy of an observable. The dual system has its time reversed with respect to the original system, leading us to a novel kind of CTP theorem.},

Our edge Laplacian is not the graph Laplacian on the line graph but rather it arises as the noncommutative Laplace-Beltrami operator on differential 1-forms, where we use the language of differential algebras to functorially interpret a graph as providing a ‘finite manifold structure’ on the set of vertices. We equip any graph with a canonical ‘Euclidean metric’ and a canonical bimodule connection, and in the case of a Cayley graph we construct a metric compatible connection for the Euclidean metric. We make use of results on bimodule connections on inner calculi on algebras, which we prove, including a general relation between zero curvature and the braid relations.},

We take a first look at some issues for quantum gravity on the lattice line. We also examine 1 + 0 dimensional scalar quantum theory with mass m and the lattice line as discrete time. As an application, we compute discrete time cosmological particle creation for a step function jump in the metric by a factor , finding that an initial vacuum state has at later times an occupancy in the continuum limit, independently of the frequency.

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to introduce a new approach to the modal operators of necessity and possibility. This approach is based on the existence of two negations in certain lattices that we call bi-Heyting algebras. Modal operators are obtained by iterating certain combinations of these negations and going to the limit. Examples of these operators are given by means of graphs.},
