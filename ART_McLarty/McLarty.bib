He studied algebra with Emmy Noether, and both mathematics and philosophy with Hermann Weyl. As a young algebraist he created today’s standard working method for mathematical structure: category theory, with topologist Samuel Eilenberg. As one step, they created the now standard definition of “isomorphism.” They originally saw categories as just a working tool. But in the 1950s, Mac Lane saw Alexander Grothendieck and others radically extend the range of the theory, and in the 1960s, he took up William Lawvere’s idea of categorical foundations. The essay relates all of this to current philosophical structuralism, especially concerning isomorphisms and automorphisms of structures. It concludes by comparing Mac Lane’s motives for structuralist working mathematics with current philosophical motives for structuralist ontology.},

	doi = {10.2307/421139},
	abstract = {Hilbert's finitist program was not created at the beginning of the twenties solely to counteract Brouwer's intuitionism, but rather emerged out of broad philosophical reflections on the foundations of mathematics and out of detailed logical work; that is evident from notes of lecture courses that were given by Hilbert and prepared in collaboration with Bernays during the period from 1917 to 1922. These notes reveal a dialectic progression from a critical logicism through a radical constructivism toward finitism; the progression has to be seen against the background of the stunning presentation of mathematical logic in the lectures given during the winter term 1917/18. In this paper, I sketch the connection of Hilbert's considerations to issues in the foundations of mathematics during the second half of the 19th century, describe the work that laid the basis of modern mathematical logic, and analyze the first steps in the new subject of proof theory. A revision of the standard view of Hilbert's and Bernays's contributions to the foundational discussion in our century has long been overdue. It is almost scandalous that their carefully worked out notes have not been used yet to understand more accurately the evolution of modern logic in general and of Hilbert's Program in particular. One conclusion will be obvious: the dogmatic formalist Hilbert is a figment of historical (de)construction! Indeed, the study and analysis of these lectures reveal a depth of mathematical-logical achievement and of philosophical reflection that is remarkable. In the course of my presentation many questions are raised and many more can be explored; thus, I hope this paper will stimulate interest for new historical and systematic work.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the status of mathematical knowledge in mid-century America. It is motivated by questions such as: when did mathematical theories become applicable to a wide range of fields from medicine to the social science? How did this change occur? I ask after the implications of this transformation for the development of mathematics as an academic discipline and how it affected what it meant to be a mathematician. How did mathematicians understand the relation between abstractions and generalizations on the one hand and their manifestation in concrete problems on the other? Mathematics in Cold War America was caught between the sciences and the humanities. This dissertation tracks the ways this tension between the two shaped the development of professional identities, pedagogical regimes, and the epistemological commitments of the American mathematical community in the postwar period. Focusing on the constructed division between pure and applied mathematics, it therefore investigates the relationship of scientific ideas to academic and governmental institutions, showing how the two are mutually inclusive. Examining the disciplinary formation of postwar mathematics, I show how ideas about what mathematics is and what it should be crystallized in institutional contexts, and how in turn these institutions reshaped those ideas. Tuning in to the ways different groups of mathematicians strove to make sense of the transformations in their fields and the way they struggled to implement their ideological convictions into specific research agendas and training programs sheds light on the co-construction of mathematics, the discipline, and mathematics as a body of knowledge. The relation between pure and applied mathematics and between mathematics and the rest of the sciences were disciplinary concerns as much as they were philosophical musings. As the reconfiguration of the mathematical field during the second half of the twentieth century shows, the dynamic relation between the natural and the human sciences reveals as much about institutions, practices, and nations as it does about epistemological commitments.},
