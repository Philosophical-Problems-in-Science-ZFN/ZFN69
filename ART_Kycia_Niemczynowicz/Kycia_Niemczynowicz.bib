	abstract = {The Landauer principle asserts that “the information is physical”. In its strict meaning, Landauer’s principle states that there is a minimum possible amount of energy required to erase one bit of information, known as the Landauer bound     W =  k B  T l n 2    , where T is the temperature of a thermal reservoir used in the process and      k B      is Boltzmann’s constant. Modern computers use the binary system in which a number is expressed in the base-2 numeral system. We demonstrate that the Landauer principle remains valid for the physical computing device based on the ternary, and more generally, N-based logic. The energy necessary for erasure of one bit of information (the Landauer bound)     W =  k B  T l n 2     remains untouched for the computing devices exploiting a many-valued logic.},

The construction, called the Landauer’s connection, describes coupling between two systems with entropy. It is straightforward and transfers changes in one system to the other one, preserving ordering structure induced by entropy. The Landauer’s connection simplifies the description of the classical Landauer’s principle for computational systems. Categorification and generalization of the Landauer’s principle opens the area of modeling of various systems in presence of entropy in abstract terms.},

A generalized lower bound on dissipation is derived for partially observable information engines which are allowed to use temperature differences. It is shown that the retention of irrelevant information limits efficiency. A data representation strategy is derived from optimizing a fundamental physical limit to information processing: minimizing the lower bound on dissipation leads to a data compression method that maximally retains relevant, predictive, information. In that sense, predictive inference emerges as the strategy that least precludes energy efficiency.},

No longer the exclusive preserve of pure mathematicians, it is now proving itself to be a powerful tool in science, informatics, and industry. By facilitating communication between communities and building rigorous bridges between disparate worlds, applied category theory has the potential to be a major organizing force. This book offers a self-contained tour of applied category theory. Each chapter follows a single thread motivated by a real-world application and discussed with category-theoretic tools. We see data migration as an adjoint functor, electrical circuits in terms of monoidal categories and operads, and collaborative design via enriched profunctors. All the relevant category theory, from simple to sophisticated, is introduced in an accessible way with many examples and exercises, making this an ideal guide even for those without experience of university-level mathematics.},
